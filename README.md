## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Price Dynamics in the Departments of Colombia: Estimation of the Neo-Keynesian Phillips Curve
**Code:**  [`Tesis.r`](https://github.com/JuanCely999/Proyectos/tree/main/R_code/Tesis).

**Description:**  This project is carried out for the [`degree thesis`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJCswhReXtnIM9o9RTMOHxmNLDNN_Q9w/view) and its subsequent [`article`](http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/le/n97/0120-2596-le-97-11.pdf).The dynamics of inflation in the departmental economies of Colombia in the last decade are described from the construction of inflation and labor income of workers in each department according to data from the GEIH deposited in DANE in monthly data between 2010- 2019. This information is found in microdata, allowing data cleaning. Then, geospatial statistical and econometric analysis is carried out, in time series and panel data. In addition, the annexes are attached with a bibliometric study of the historical behavior of the theory treated in neural networks.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transforms, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, bibliometric analysis, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate.

**Technology:**   R, STATA, SQL, Python, Latex.

**Results:**  Price formation presents differential behaviors between the geographical regions of the country. The departments in the center of the country are less likely to have their companies keep prices unchanged, highlighting the role of expected inflation and marginal costs. On the contrary, the departments of the coastal zones show a greater degree of rigidity in prices, since the companies take more time to modify them. The results are oriented to the conduct of monetary policy in Colombia.


### Global trends and public policy elements
**Code:** [`tenden_gober`](https://github.com/JuanCely999/Proyectos/tree/main/R_code/tenden_gober).

**Description:**  This project is carried out as a [`chapter`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXDxFMGyrlxw8F0Gkpce5xlz-Sns-pri/view) of this [`book`](https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=2tpDEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT7&ots=jYyLG_utmi&sig=OeZ5CMawDe1yJFEGnS_-seOh_Q0#v=onepage&q&f=false). A bibliometric analysis of the publications in databases such as Scopus and Web of Science is carried out. Neural networks are created in cooperation by country, university and author. In addition, web scrapping is carried out on Twitter to analyze the interaction on tourism issues for the population of Colombia, South America, North America, South Asia, South Africa, Europe and Oceania. Sentiment analysis is carried out, opinion mining. Finally, the trends in Google in the national and international tourism market are analyzed.

**Skills:** Sentyment analysis, opinion mining, data mining, bibliometric analysis, data cleaning, data transforms, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization. 

**Technology:**   R, Python, Vantage point, google analytics.

**Results:** A large part of the publications on tourism address issues that currently lack sufficient research, such as the case of the impact that social networks and web pages have on the dissemination of information and acceptance by the general public. The comments and searches focused on tourism on the web, at the moment of reducing their intensity, governance appears more frequently -although due to non-conformity- as the absence of global factors that the world is currently going through.

### Perceptions of Rural Community Based Tourism in the Province of Alto Ricaurte, Boyaca
**Code:** [`alto_ricaurte.r`](https://github.com/JuanCely999/Proyectos/tree/main/R_code/alto_ricaurte).

**Description:**  This project is carried out for the publication of this [`article`](http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/soec/n47/2389-9050-soec-47-e10111358.pdf). Interviews were conducted with officials from public institutions, rural tourism actors, representatives of community action boards and producer associations to obtain a better approach to the development possibilities of rural community tourism. A textual analysis is carried out.

**Skills:** descriptive statistics, data visualization, opinion mining, data mining.

**Technology:**  R, Python.

**Results:** It was identified in the interviews through opinion mining that "trust" allows or leads to arrangements that favor the entire society inhabiting the region, consensus in which individuals and authorities can define the type of tourism development, which is the aspect of this investigation.

### Input output analysis an application for the economy of Boyaca Colombia
**Code:** [`analisis_insumo.r`](https://github.com/JuanCely999/Proyectos/tree/main/R_code/analisis_insumo).

**Description:**  This project is carried out for the publication of this [`article`](http://revistas.ustatunja.edu.co/index.php/ivestigium/article/view/1720/1567). Based on the branches of economic activity, the base, independent, key and driving sectors are determined according to matrix calculations. Then the income, employment and product multipliers are evaluated by correlations and 3D visualizations. 

**Skills:**  descriptive statistics, data visualization, data cleaning, data transforms, data analysis.

**Technology:** Advanced Excel, R. 

**Results:** Low multipliers in most branches of the economy which demonstrates the low diversification of the economy and backwardness compared to other departments. There is little integration of the economy, this is denoted by the exaggerated number of independent sectors and the incipient key sectors.
