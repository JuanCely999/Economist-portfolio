# Juan Pablo Cely  - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Juan Pabo Cely! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Geoscience from Saint Petersburg Mining University, with a major in Seismic Data Processing and Analysis. I have 12 years of experience in the field of geoscience, where I held roles such as Data Processing Engineer, Head of Department, and CTO in a technological startup. After a year of transitioning from geoscience to Data Analysis, I am currently a Data Analyst at a Fintech company, starting from June 2021.      
Achieved the 7th place at the open Data Analyst 2021 competition held by [Career Factory.](https://contest.careerfactory.ru/contest_inside/1618853698875x612895580932538400)
